    "value": "A type of blended mortgage loan which avoids private mortgage insurance (PMI). It consists of an 80% - 30 year first lien at market rates, a 10% - 15 year second lien at a slightly higher interest rate, and a 10% down payment. Instead of having to come up with a 20% down payment, a buyer is able to avoid PMI with only 10% down. While the interest rate on the second note is a bit higher, the total monthly payment is usually lower than a 90% mortgage with PMI. In addition, the extra interest paid for the second lien is tax deductible, whereas PMI is not. It is also possible to payoff just the second lien, thereby lowering the future monthly payments. Some lenders also offer 75-15-10 and 80-15-5 programs. This type of mortgage also gives the consumer the option of having a non-escrowing loan without a 20% down payment."

The legal significance of a counteroffer is that it completely voids the original offer, so that if the Seller decided to sell for $160,000 the next day, the Buyer would be under no legal obligation to pay that amount for the property."

    "value": "In the mortgage lending world, credit scores either make or break you when it comes to obtaining a home mortgage or getting the best rate you can. There are three different scores available to a mortgage lender each being generated by the three different credit agencies. The most popular, known as a Fico score is from Experian (formally TRW), then there is a Beacon score from Equifax, and finally a Emperica score from Trans Union. This is the “mortgage scoring” system used to get a conventional mortgage.\nSimply, credit scores are numbers calculated based upon your credit history. The better your credit, the higher your number or score will be - the worse your credit, the lower the score. The number of inquiries or times your credit has been pulled in the past 90 days will also lower your “score”. In some instances, lack of credit results in “no score” on your report requiring you to provide “alternative credit” via your rental, utility or telephone payment histories. There’s plenty you can do to improve your score if you know how the system works. Just don’t expect much help from your lender--most consider the actual formulas a trade secret and don’t want people angling for an advantage. Congress is currently working on legislation to provide consumers with access to their credit scores and the formulas used to calculate these scores.\nThere are some lenders that do not rely on credit scores to the degree that most do. Sometimes, credit reports contain inaccuracies that lower your score, this is when a lender has to use a common sense approach to approving your loan. In some instances, you may have to correct yourcredit report, wait for your score to improve, then reapply for the loan. Talk with your mortgagebroker or lender to understand what your options are."

    "value": "A special and separate type of homeowner’s insurance the provides coverage for damages resulting from flooding. Flood insurance is required by most lenders only if the property is located within a designated flood plain. The cost of the policy is related to the associated flooding risk. If a property has a small section of land located within a flood plain, but away from the residential improvements (house), the lender will still require a policy, but its cost will be much lower.\nLikewise, flood insurance policies for properties not located within any floodplain, are fairly inexpensive.\nMost flood insurance is underwritten by the federal government through FEMA and the National Flood Insurance Program in cooperation with private insurance agencies. More than 18,000 communities participate in the Federal flood insurance program. More than 3.8 million National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) home and business policies are in effect. The United States experiences flooding threats throughout all four seasons of the year and, in fact, flooding is the most common natural disaster. There are, on average, 1000 floods per year in the U.S. Nearly everyone is at some risk of experiencing the effects of flooding. In the Houston area, 25 percent of flood-insurance claims come from areas outside a designated flood plain."

    "word": "flood plain",
    "value": "Flood plains are by definition subject to periodic flooding. They are generally characterized by relatively flat topography and soil types that were laid down during past inundations by flood waters. If your property is in the 100-year flood plain, there is a 1-in-100 chance in any given year that your property will flood. If it is in the 25-year flood plain, there is a 1-in-25 chance in any given year that your property will flood. The statistical chance of flooding is not changed by anyone flooding event; but repeated flooding may result in the flood plain being recalculated.\nA 100-year flood plain is always wider than a 25-year flood plain, and the 25-year flood plain is contained within the 100-year flood plain. The flood prone areas of the United States cover approximately 150,000 square miles or 94 million acres of land, an area roughly the size of the State of Montana. People living in flood plains are 26 times more likely to experience a flooding disaster than they are a fire disaster during the life of the 30-year mortgage on their homes.\nThe changes in flood plain maps reflect changes in land use (such as increased building activity), changes in the waterways, and flood control improvements (such as detention ponds or other flood control measures). As more lots are covered with more buildings and parking lots, the amount of water that flows into creeks and lakes increases because there is less vegetation to absorb the water when it rains. This is one reason why buildings that were not originally built in a flood plain are now in the 25-year or 100-year flood plain."

Likewise, multiple home builders are included in the construction of the various neighborhoods. Commercial development can consist of retail strip centers and shopping malls, restaurants, entertainment venues and office buildings.\nIn addition, master-planned communities usually offer amenities such as public recreation areas and parks, neighborhood schools and extensive landscaping. Recreation areas may include public swimming pools, tennis courts, children’s playgrounds and sports fields. Many offer large water features and public or private golf courses.\nThe term “master-planned” has become somewhat of an overused buzzword in the current market place. True master-planned communities require a multi-year commitment from the developer and contain thousands of homes."

This type of rental also provides a landlord with an easy way to get rid of troublesome tenants, because in most states’ month-to-month tenancies can be terminated for any reason.

When all three of the usual costs--taxes, maintenance and insurance--are passed on, the arrangement is known as a “triple net lease.” Because these costs are variable and almost never decrease, a net lease favors the landlord. Accordingly, it may be possible for a tenant to bargain for a net lease with caps or ceilings, which limits the amount of rent the tenant must pay. For example, a net lease with caps may specify that an increase in taxes beyond a certain point (or any new taxes) will be paid by the landlord.
