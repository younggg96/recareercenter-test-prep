It consists of an 80% - 30 year first lien at market rates, a 10% - 15 year second lien at a slightly higher interest rate, and a 10% down payment. Instead of having to come up with a 20% down payment, a buyer is able to avoid PMI with only 10% down. While the interest rate on the second note is a bit higher, the total monthly payment is usually lower than a 90% mortgage with PMI. In addition, the extra interest paid for the second lien is tax deductible, whereas PMI is not. It is also possible to payoff just the second lien, thereby lowering the future monthly payments. Some lenders also offer 75-15-10 and 80-15-5 programs. This type of mortgage also gives the consumer the option of having a non-escrowing loan without a 20% down payment."

There are three different scores available to a mortgage lender each being generated by the three different credit agencies. The most popular, known as a Fico score is from Experian (formally TRW), then there is a Beacon score from Equifax, and finally a Emperica score from Trans Union. This is the “mortgage scoring” system used to get a conventional mortgage.\r\nSimply, credit scores are numbers calculated based upon your credit history. The better your credit, the higher your number or score will be - the worse your credit, the lower the score. The number of inquiries or times your credit has been pulled in the past 90 days will also lower your “score”. In some instances, lack of credit results in “no score” on your report requiring you to provide “alternative credit” via your rental, utility or telephone payment histories. There’s plenty you can do to improve your score if you know how the system works. Just don’t expect much help from your lender--most consider the actual formulas a trade secret and don’t want people angling for an advantage. Congress is currently working on legislation to provide consumers with access to their credit scores and the formulas used to calculate these scores.\r\nThere are some lenders that do not rely on credit scores to the degree that most do. Sometimes, credit reports contain inaccuracies that lower your score, this is when a lender has to use a common sense approach to approving your loan. In some instances, you may have to correct yourcredit report, wait for your score to improve, then reapply for the loan. Talk with your mortgagebroker or lender to understand what your options are."

If it is in the 25-year flood plain, there is a 1-in-25 chance in any given year that your property will flood. The statistical chance of flooding is not changed by anyone flooding event; but repeated flooding may result in the flood plain being recalculated.\r\nA 100-year flood plain is always wider than a 25-year flood plain, and the 25-year flood plain is contained within the 100-year flood plain. The flood prone areas of the United States cover approximately 150,000 square miles or 94 million acres of land, an area roughly the size of the State of Montana. People living in flood plains are 26 times more likely to experience a flooding disaster than they are a fire disaster during the life of the 30-year mortgage on their homes.\r\nThe changes in flood plain maps reflect changes in land use (such as increased building activity), changes in the waterways, and flood control improvements (such as detention ponds or other flood control measures). As more lots are covered with more buildings and parking lots, the amount of water that flows into creeks and lakes increases because there is less vegetation to absorb the water when it rains. This is one reason why buildings that were not originally built in a flood plain are now in the 25-year or 100-year flood plain."

Mobile homes do not require any foundation or substructure. They sit up off the ground, with skirting used around the base to hide the wheel and jacks. While it is possible to tie down a mobile home to a piece of land, using straps and screw-in anchors, the structures are very susceptible to high winds and tornados."

This type of rental also provides a landlord with an easy way to get rid of troublesome tenants, because in most states’ month-to-month tenancies can be terminated for any reason. It is also common for leases torevert to month-to-month tenancies at the end of the original lease period, if another lease has notbeen signed."
